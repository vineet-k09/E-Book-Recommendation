💥 Here’s how you keep it SAFE:
1️⃣ Create a new folder → /scripts (you may already have it)

2️⃣ Inside, make a file like → exportInteractions.js

3️⃣ In that script:

Connect to MongoDB

Fetch interactions → Book.find().lean()

Save as JSON, CSV, or Parquet file

Use hdfs dfs -put or a Hadoop Node.js client to push it to HDFS

4️⃣ DON’T import your app.js or Express stuff

Just import the mongoose models (Book.js, User.js)

No need to touch routes, controllers, middleware

5️⃣ Test locally

First write to a local file → make sure data looks right

Only after that → send to HDFS

🔥 Example: Safe exportInteractions.js
js
Copy
Edit
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const fs = require('fs');
const Book = require('../models/Book');

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/ebookdb', {
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true
});

async function exportInteractions() {
    try {
        const books = await Book.find().lean();
        fs.writeFileSync('interactions.json', JSON.stringify(books, null, 2));
        console.log('✅ Exported to interactions.json');
        mongoose.disconnect();
    } catch (err) {
        console.error('❌ Error exporting interactions:', err);
    }
}

exportInteractions();
Once you confirm the interactions.json looks good →
use terminal:

swift
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -put interactions.json /user/yourusername/interactions/
BOOM → no backend breakage, no auth headache.

⚡ My strong advice:
Keep anything “batch” or “analytics” OUTSIDE the backend folder

Treat it like a cron script → totally detached from app code

Avoid importing routes, middleware, Express → just models + DB

💥 Next step I suggest:
I can help you write the exact export script

And give you the MapReduce + Hive table skeletons

Then we wire up Spark MLlib after that

Want me to write that export script fully for you? Say the word, commander. 🫡
