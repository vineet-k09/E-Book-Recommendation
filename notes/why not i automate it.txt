ðŸ§  Can This Be Automated?
Technically: Yes
With a cronjob or a Node script + node-cron, you can easily:

Export data hourly

Dump to HDFS

Trigger HiveQL queries

Optionally notify Spark for batch jobs

Practically: NOPE not on your laptop
Youâ€™re right â€” running:

MongoDB

Hadoop daemons (NameNode, DataNode, ResourceManager, NodeManager)

Hive Metastore & CLI

Spark master/worker

Express backend

Next.js frontend

â€¦is like making your toaster run a space program.

Later when you're cloud-deploying:

Use Airflow / AWS Glue / Databricks Workflows to automate ETL
