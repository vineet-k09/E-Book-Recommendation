output/output.txt
user_id,book_id<TAB>rating

Train a Collaborative Filtering model (ALS).
Use it to recommend books.
Later match MongoDB book/user info by ID if needed.


Spark ALS doesn't use genres or text dataâ€”it learns user preferences based on implicit rating patterns (that 11, 6, 2 etc.). For genre-based filtering, do that post-processing in frontend or with MongoDB cross-check.
