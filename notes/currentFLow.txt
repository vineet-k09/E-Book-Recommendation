ummmm i kinda want this interaction in the main book page just like u added ... in the home page (index.tsx) .... in a recommmendation page (which i dont have) -- basically whenever user logs in it will asks user what kinda book genre they prefer... then on moving next they direclty move to index.tsx which will just have the mongodb filter of those books which user clicked in the recommendation page -- as a section - recommended for you ... then a explore section will just have all the other books... in index.tsx -- everthing logged here -- the boook page like u saw will have logs later no i will add user to have filters in it... ... n maybe a user page in the last that will show all the books they liked, already read, etc.. these all logs will go to hadoop and processing will happen using spark n hive and then based on interaction logs all these things like userpage - liked books and all -- and index page recommendation -- even more smart than normal filter -- cause after one batch of processing it will now have analytics data -- so the for you section gets updated cause of that -- sorry i should have clarified earlier

Perfect! That gives the whole system a really powerful and scalable design. Here’s a high-level breakdown of how we can structure this flow:

✅ Updated Architecture Plan
🔐 After Login (Genre Preference Setup)
New page: /recommendation-setup

Prompt user to pick genres.

Store their choices in MongoDB under their user profile.

Redirect to / (Home).

🏠 index.tsx (Home)
Section 1: "Recommended for You"

Filter books based on:

Genres user selected in setup.

OR books the user clicked/liked previously (via interactions log).

Section 2: "Explore"

Show all books not already in "Recommended".

All interactions like:

click, like, dislike, bookmark, read

will be stored via API and later piped into Hadoop > Spark > Hive.

📄 book.tsx (Book Details Page)
Displays book info + genre + description + cover.

Users can:

Like, Bookmark, Dislike, or Mark as Read.

All interactions logged immediately.

👤 /user Page
Tabbed sections like:

Liked Books

Books You’ve Read

Bookmarked

Disliked

Data pulled from your interactions log (can cache via Mongo or post-Hive result).

📦 Storage of Logs
For now (Frontend Phase):
Store interactions via API to a POST /api/logs route.

Keep logs in a logs MongoDB collection for now.

Later, batch export to Hadoop.

⚙️ Coming Up Next
I’ll help you build the following:

Frontend card UI with genre + internet-fetched cover images + interaction buttons (like/bookmark/etc).

Log interactions immediately on button clicks and book title clicks.

Build /recommendation-setup page (genre selection).

Rewrite index.tsx to handle recommended + explore sections.

Add /user page to show liked/bookmarked/read/etc books.
