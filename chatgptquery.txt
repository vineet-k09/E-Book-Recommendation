Alright, bro — now we’re in beast mode. 💥⚙️

You’re actually setting things up decently, BUT we need to think carefully because your architecture spans two worlds:

✅ MongoDB (app backend) → flexible, stores preferences, interactions, user-facing data
✅ HDFS / MapReduce / Hive / Spark MLlib (big data side) → batch processing, analytics, recommendations, trends

So here’s the honest analysis:

💬 Current schema (MongoDB side)
js
Copy
Edit
interactions: [{
    userId: String,
    action: 'bookmark' | 'like' | 'dislike' | 'read',
    timestamp: Date
}]
✅ This works for MongoDB → you can easily query per book, per user, sort by time, count likes, etc.

BUT…

⚠️ This alone won’t handle the HDFS + big data part — you’ll need to export these interactions regularly to HDFS to process with MapReduce, Hive, and Spark.

🛠️ How you can handle the big data pipeline:
Store in MongoDB → Export to HDFS

Set up a batch job (cron or backend script) that:

Periodically dumps MongoDB interactions into a CSV / JSON file

Uploads that to HDFS

MapReduce over metadata

Write MapReduce jobs to:

Count total likes, bookmarks, reads per genre, author, etc.

Calculate user engagement

Maybe clean or aggregate noisy data

Hive for querying

Create Hive tables on top of HDFS interaction + metadata files

Run ad-hoc queries:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT genre, COUNT(*) FROM interactions WHERE action = 'like' GROUP BY genre;
Spark MLlib for recommendations

Use exported interaction data (userId, bookId, action) to:

Train collaborative filtering models (ALS)

Recommend books per user

Web analytics on trending books

Either:

Run Spark jobs to identify trending books + push to MongoDB → show on the frontend

OR integrate with something like Google Analytics, but Spark + MongoDB is more “in-house”

🚀 Summary of your current approach:
✅ Storing interactions in MongoDB → Good

⚠️ HDFS/Big Data integration → Not yet ready

You need a pipeline to move data from MongoDB → HDFS

Then plug in MapReduce, Hive, Spark on top of HDFS

🔥 My recommendations
Keep your MongoDB schema as it is

Build a batch export job → HDFS (Node.js script or Python)

Define Hive tables over HDFS data

Write small Spark MLlib prototype (even on local Spark if no cluster yet)

Add a “trending” API in your backend that queries MongoDB or Hive

💣 Here’s what I want to know to help you further:
Are you running Hadoop + Spark locally, on a cluster, or cloud (AWS EMR)?

Will the app have real-time recommendations or is it okay if they update daily/weekly?

Do you have user login/registration already set up?

Will frontend display analytics + recommendations, or only backend?

Do you already have book metadata (author, genre, summary, etc.) in MongoDB?

If you answer those, I can help you sketch the perfect workflow + code architecture!
You’re very close to doing this right — just need to connect the webapp and big data brains. 🧠⚡

And bro, I’m hyped to help you nail this! 🚀
